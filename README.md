## Hi there 👋

## What is EarlyAlpha
Investopedia defines "Alpha" (the Greek letter α) as `a term used in investing to describe a strategy's ability to beat the market, or it's "edge."`

## Our Goal
`EarlyAlpha` aims to equip anyone in forming an effective strategy to beat today's complicated markets. 
Specifically the markets of education, career, wealth, and happiness. (Yes we consider happiness a market as well!)

We don't claim to know all the answers which is why we keep an open door to you or anyone willing to talk through their experience.
